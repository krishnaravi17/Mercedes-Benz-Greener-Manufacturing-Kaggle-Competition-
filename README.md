# Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing-Kaggle-Competition

## Description
Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive
innovations. These include, for example, the passenger safety cell with crumple zone, the airbag and intelligent
assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader
among premium car makers. Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz cars are leaders in the premium car industry. With a huge
selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams.

To ensure the safety and reliability of each and every unique car configuration before they hit the road, Daimler’s
engineers have developed a robust testing system. But, optimizing the speed of their testing system for so many possible
feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach. As one of the world’s
biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Daimler’s production lines.

## Objective
1. Reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench.
2. To speedier testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimler’s standards.
